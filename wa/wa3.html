                <img src="../img/moundvilleTribeEyeHandDisk.jpg" alt="The Moundville Eye-Hand Disk, which is a Hand with an Eye in the middle, surrounded by two snakes.">
                <p>The <strong>Moundville People</strong>of central Alabama were a native peoples known for their funerary practices
                    and their mysterious, rapid decline and extinction. "Researchers believe the hand and eye design found on the 
                    Rattlesnake Disk and other Moundville artifacts possibly represents the constellation we now know as Orion.  
                    Orion's “Belt” represents the wrist of the downturned hand, in the center of which is a small cluster of stars.  
                    This cluster is a portal, or gateway, through which the souls of the dead traveled to reach the path of souls 
                    which follows the Milky Way.  As the hand rises over the western sky, traveling souls must leap across the chasm 
                    into the portal before the hand rises above the horizon." (Moundville Museum)</p>

                    <p> The <strong>Huichol People</strong>of Mexico developed a different symbol for protection, but also included the 
                    Eye as the focal point. "Ojos de Dios (oh-ho-day-DEE-ohs), “god's eyes,” are ritual objects made by the Huichol
                    (wet-chol) indigenous people of Mexico.The Huichol symbolism of the god's eyes is primarily associated with the 
                    prayers for their children - prayers for a good long life, protection and to insure abundant crops."

                <p>The <strong>Atayal People</strong> are an aboriginal tribe from Taiwan. "It is said that
                    the checker is the symbol of the eye, representing the blessing of the ancestral spirit."

                <p>The <strong>Paiwan People</strong> are another aboriginal tribe from Taiwan with emphasis on bead-making.
                    "According to the Paiwan legend, Paiwan ancestors made “glass beads” with the beautiful eyes of dragonflies,
                    so glass beads are a gift from the gods." (Council on Indigenous Peoples of Taiwan)</p>

                <img src="../img/pexels-meruyert-gonullu-6243720.jpg" alt="Doorway with a Hamsa, or Evil Eye, symbol next to the door.">
                <p>Both <strong>Jewish</strong> and <strong>Islamic</strong> cultures place heavy emphasis on the <em>Hamsa</em>, or Evil Eye.
                    "The Hamsa/Hand of Fatima is a hand that holds many different meanings to a wide range of cultures, including Judaism 
                    and Islam. Hamsa, or “khamsa” (خمسة) in Arabic, means five: a number associated with the Evil Eye, the five pillars 
                    of Islam, and of course, the five fingers on the symbolic hand itself. Providing protection from the Evil Eye, this 
                    symbol is especially popular amongst both sides of my family, being Middle Eastern and Jewish."

                <img src="../img/Jacopo_Pontormo_001-medium.jpg" alt="Renaissance Era painting that depicts the Supper at Emmaus with Jesus and his disciples being watched over by an eye surrounded by a triangle of light.">
                <p>In the <em>Renaissance Era</em> <strong>Christian</strong> artists would paint the symbol known as <em>The Eye of Providence</em>
                to represent God's presence. "In this painting by Pontormo, the Eye of Providence looks down upon the gathering of 
                the disciples with Christ, when he reveals himself in the sharing of the cup and bread. This symbol, known today as 
                part of U.S. currency design, has been used for centuries to indicate God's presence. In this painting by Pontormo, 
                the symbol communicates God's watching over humankind. Much as the dove symbolizes God's presence in the incarnation, 
                the Eye of Providence evokes the union of Christ with God after his resurrection." (Vanderbilt University)</p>
